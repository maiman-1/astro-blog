It has been a while. So many has changed in the world of IT in the last year after the release of the some of the amazing Language Processing Artificial intelligence, like the Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT). I've been busy with so many live changes during the past year -  I've moved and I did my internship. Most of all.... I finished my study without updating this site. OOPS!

Anyways... I want to try something new with this page. People have been clamoring on about AIs and I wanted to try adding that. Sounds interesting and fun. That's what matters in life and that's what I want to focus this site on from now on. Sharing stuff that interests me.

I've asked the Bing AI to generate the above image and it turned out great. Very cute and kawaii. The prompt I use to generate is also very simple: "Can you generate an image of the "Ehe" anime girl that slaps herself on the head with both her hands but with a blue haired elven mage?".

I supposed I am due for a life update. Here are some updates I would like to mention.

# Life Update
Life Updates:
- I've finished my three months internship in a software house company. I feel like I want to make a separate post about this and the struggles that I went through.
- I went through both Semester 1 and Semester 2 of my final year. Also, upcoming post on my fyp and why it's quite important to pick a good topic on your fyp.
- Lastly, I want to mention that I've somehow managed to finish my studies, pretty sure with first class honors. At least, according to the honors classification for Monash Malaysia.

# Future plans for Site
Actually did some comtemplating on whether or not I should update this site to a more flashier framework. Honestly, I decided against updating this site because I feel somewhat attached to it. It's like seeing an old toy that you've hold onto since you were a child. I can't help but exclaim "Man, this site is dumb but it's the site I've made when I was dumb so, it doesn't matter". There's a lot of things I'm still learning and I've gained some wisdom along the way but, some things are better kept the old way.

Future plans for this site include, not only posts on my studies but also posts on my hobbies, my travels, etc. So, I'm not only going to be focused on what I learned in my degree but, what I've been up to and also, what I've learned. One thing I've always want to create for this site is the ability to sort it by category and also the ability to search for specific. With the amount of posts I have now, it doesn't seem like it's worth it. Also, longer posts. I want to try to make sure each of my post is up to 500 words at least. Why? No reason. I just want the page to stretch longer and make it look better.

# Testing AI and My Thoughts on AIs

The above image is created using Bing with the prompt: "Can you make the mages sit in front of a laptop and write?". AIs have always have a problems with hands. This girl's hand is no different and it is messed up. That is one long arm and she is literally a slay queen writing backwards. A true girl boss. Keep up the good work!

Also, I noticed that her ears are not exactly elven. They're more like Evee's ears from Pokemon. This could be considered somewhat of a failure for the image generation engine.

This one, on the other hand, is using Character.ai. Specifically the 2389 AD director. Character.ai image generation is not as impressive as Bing's. Bing uses one of the most leaders in AI image generation, DALL-E and I don't really see any info on what Character.AI uses. It must be a custom engine since even Stable Diffusion can create a more realistic looking image than the one we see now.

## Thoughts
What are my thoughts on AIs? An interesting line I've heard from Michio Kaku on ChatGPT illustrate a bit of what I thought on AIs and ChatGPT. ChatGPT is just a glorified tape recorder. It is. It doesn't really evaluate whether the contents of its response. It's just a bunch of maths that randomly generate that particular response in a manner that seems humanlike. The humanlike characteristic was gained during training after being fed a lot of data.

There's so many topics to discuss on AIs that I can make an entirely new blog site about so I ask Bing what topics about AI should I talk about. The first topic it came out with was about the ethical challenges and risk it creates for humanity. I would touch on this with a FYP topic that a friend of mine was invovled with, which was evaluating whether there is a gender bias in Artificial Intelligence. One challenge that makers of AI have to face is that just because a particular bias exist in real life doesn't make the bias should exist in an AI. This is a particularly interesting point for me because if you think of search engines like Googles, it makes sense for them to show way more nurses when you search for it because nurses is a female-dominated role. To compensate for this real life bias, male nurses have to actually be pushed up compared to female nurses and this will have be done for AIs as well where the minority will have be propped up in the AI's response as a way to promote more inclusion.

# Final Words

That will be all for this post today. Contact me with email or with LinkedIn. I've enjoyed making this post today and I hope to enjoy creating more with this site.
