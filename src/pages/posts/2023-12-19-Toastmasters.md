# Introduction
Toastmasters International (TI) is a non-profit educational organization that focuses on providing professionals with a safe space to develop their communication, and leadership skill. It was founded by Ralph C. Medley on October 22, 1924 in Santa Ana, California, who wanted young men to practice their communication skills in a safe and supportive environment. Over the last almost 100 years, the organization grew all over U.S and all around the world, with members consisting of various ethnicity, culture, nationality, background, and identities [1].

TMIKL was born as part of the Toastmasters International organization, and as far as I can tell, was started in 1977 by Peter Shepard as the oldest Toastmasters organization in Kuala Lumpur [2]. Now, it boasts more than 35 members, and more than 1000 meetings under its belt [3]. People who are in the know about TMIKL will describe it the same way, "The oldest club with the youngest members". The club boasts a spirit of youth, and support.

# How I came to join Toastmasters
## The Right Tool for the Right Job
A big reason as to why I joined Toastmasters will be due to an unconvensional reason, my laptop. I was made aware of the difficulties that TMIKL was having with its hybrid setup over the last year as my brother frequently talked about how the various devices they had just aren't suited for the job. It was a matter of certain laptops not having the appropriate and necessary HDMI port, something that professional IT officers have to deal with on a daily basis. They managed to get through it just fine during the last year. During April or May, my brother took a good look at my laptop and saw that it has not only an HDMI port, but also, a USB-C port, and a USB port. Basically, my laptop had all the ports that TMIKL needed for its hybrid setup.

Upon finishing my studies, I had nothing to do, and my brother persuaded me to come over, and go to a test meeting for a meeting for a new club that was about to be established. I was blown away by the positivity, and support given by everyone during the meeting. I had expected some false sense of support, ones given typically by the corpo-drones but, that wasn't what happened at the meeting. Seeing as I was pleasantly surprised by the ordeal. My brother told me to go to the TMIKL meeting, not just to see the meeting for myself but, also so that he can use my laptop for the meeting setup. Wanting to help him, I followed him along and went for the meeting.

Having all the ports needed for the meeting, the setup for the meeting went smoothly, and most everyone agreed that the overall experience was positive for both the physical attendees and the online attendees. This is much to the chagrin of the previous president, who exclaimed how the setup was much difficult last year. I didn't know what to say other than, it was the right tool for the right job.
