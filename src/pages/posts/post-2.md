One of the units I was enrolled in in the second semester period of my study was
a very interesting unit about web applications. This unit was of course titled
as **ENG1003: Engineering Mobile Applications**.

While the title of the unit would lead you to believe that I was involved in
creating JAVA applications that was designed to be used on mobile
phones exclusively, the unit actually made us develop browser applications using
 HTML and JAVA.

In the course of this unit, we had to develop at the very minimum 8 projects,
most of which only had one page and some of them, including the final project of
this unit involve us working in groups to develop an application for a flight
booking management system for the passengers.

Since they were mostly very simple pages, involving very minimal inputs, the
source code of the projects will be directly be put on GitHub. The result or
output can be run by downloading the code yourself and running the code in a browser.
