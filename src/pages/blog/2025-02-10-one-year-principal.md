# New Job, New Responsibilities, New Life Situation

Hey. Sorry for the lack of update to whomever is reading this. It would be weird if anyone is reading since I mainly write this for my own satisfaction. To make things short, here are the list of things that happened last year:

* I got a new job
* My family moved with me. I am currently living with my parents.
* I got an exco role as Vice President of Public Relations at TMIKL Toastmasters club.

To make the word count for this, let's go over some things that I learned over the course of the year for the three items above.

# New Job, New Responsibilities

I guess thanks to this blog that my manager was impressed with, I managed to land a new job. Man, looking back at the start of my job, I really was like a fish out of water. Mostly due to my own ineptitude.

I can't really speak much about my job. Industry secrets, and everything. In fact, my boss already warned me beforehand not write too much about my role. I will just gloss over what I have learned throughout the year in my role.

The first thing that I was exasperated by when I first joined was the amount of managing I had to. I struggled with my first project because halfway through, I learned that I was made into a project lead, and it was my responsibility to ensure that the project made progress. I had to learn the system quickly and before I knew it, I was told to teach others who had been there longer than me about the system.

But, overall, I am quite content with my role. I got a lot of benefits, an insurance, the claim is generous. The pay could be more but, this is my first role. I'm not complaining. In case you're reading this, hi Yew Ban.

Also, CICD. I'm using it for this blog starting forward. The best way to learn about a system, it turns out, is to use it. I am using the inbuilt github systems because dang if it isn't very useful for a large team to keep on top of stuff. It turns out open source projects get updated really often. I hope to be able to keep on top of the security fixes and use the stuff my team currently implements like tagging.

# Family Situation

Let's be real. With my pay right now, I can't really afford my lifestyle. I have to give it to my dad who was willing to move all the way to Kuala Lumpur and pay for the place I am currently staying at. Hopefully, within the next few years, I'll be making enough to live in KL (I hope I didn't just jinxed myslef)

No girlfriend yet though. Sadge.

# Vice President of Public Relations at TMIKL!

Part of why I'm so busy is I have been busy generating social media content for my club~

I've been managing, creating posters, and keeping up to date with my club's social media pages! Honestly, creating posters is really a lot of fun! I'm surprised at how much I enjoyed arts. In the past, I didn't know how easy and accessible content creation can be for beginners. I'm not gonna go into too much depth about this but do know man, I really want to create more banners, and more artsy stuff for this blog!

# Future

I'm not the type to really plan for the future but, I do want to have a list of things to achieve before the end of year.

* AWS SysOps Admin certifications
* Create 3 blog updates and/or short stories somewhere
* Create more art and stuff related to that to this blog

Just in time for Chinese New Year as well and if this doesn't work, there's always Muslim New Years :P
