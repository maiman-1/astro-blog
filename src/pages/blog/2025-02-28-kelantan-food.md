Typically, when you think about Kelantan, you would only think of Nasi Kerabu or perhaps, Nasi Dagang. Honestly, those two foods are quite overrated. Here are some food that I actually miss from Kelantan

# 1. Tapai

Tapai or Tape, is a type of fermented rice, typically eaten in a banana leaf. This food is quite a hidden gem in Malaysia due to the restrictions Islam have on alcoholic drink and guess what... This food contains up to 5% alcohol. Though, I have never seen anyone goten drunk from eating Tapai. I have a hidden suspicion that what constitutes drunken behaviour is mostly a societal one, not biological.

It's quite difficult to find Tapai nowadays outside of weddings but, when I see it, I will always try to get my hands on it. I'll just make not to drive after eating

# 2. Putu Halba

In case you're not aware, halba is the name of the spice used to create that sharper taste in the nasi dagang. It is apparently called fenugreek seeds in English.

Putu Halba is a traditional Malaysian delicacy, often enjoyed as a nostalgic treat. This kuih is made primarily from a blend of rice flour, grated coconut, and fenugreek seeds, which give it its distinctive flavor. Steamed to perfection, it is typically served warm, with a soft, crumbly texture that melts in your mouth. The slight sweetness, complemented by the earthy, slightly bitter undertones of fenugreek, makes it a unique and beloved snack.

It makes for a good snack during the rain... And I love rains.

# 3. Roti Titab

Roti Titab, a "Western-inspired" culinary creation born in Kota Bharu, is a delightful twist on a classic breakfast. At its core is a thick slice of bread, generously slathered with fragrant pandan kaya, topped with a perfectly runny half-boiled egg that crowns this masterpiece.

Yes, you read that right—bread, kaya, and a half-boiled egg! If it doesn’t sound appetizing at first, I urge you to give it a try. The creamy sweetness of the kaya is the heart of the dish; its quality makes or breaks the experience. Pair that with the rich, velvety yolk of the egg, and you’ve got a combination that’s unexpectedly harmonious. The protein of the egg rounds out the sweetness of the kaya, creating a balanced, flavorful bite. The bread, with its fluffy yet sturdy texture, ties everything together beautifully.

If I had to compare it to something familiar, it’s reminiscent of a turkey and strawberry jam sandwich—a surprising mix of savory and sweet that just works. But Roti Titab isn’t just food; it’s a unique experience born from local ingenuity.
