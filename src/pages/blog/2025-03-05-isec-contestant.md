# Why I Entered (Hint: It Wasn’t My Love for Public Speaking)

Let me set the record straight: I didn’t join out of an overwhelming desire to conquer the stage. Honestly, it was more about supporting my club and the president, who had worked so hard to qualify and represent us. I figured my participation would be a small way to contribute. Plus, as everyone kept reminding me, it was “all about the experience.”

# The Speech: Surprisingly Manageable

Surprisingly, delivering my speech wasn’t as terrifying as I’d imagined. Sure, I stumbled over a few words and forgot to breathe halfway through, but somehow, I made it to the end. The audience clapped enthusiastically—probably out of relief—and I thought, “Hey, maybe this isn’t so bad after all.”

# The Evaluation: Where It All Went Off the Rails

Then came the evaluation segment. Now, I’d practiced the format: commend, recommend, commend. I knew the drill. But the moment the speaker finished their speech—a brilliant and entertaining take on Gen Z slang—my brain decided to abandon all logic and structure. Instead of following the standard evaluation format, I went off on a tangent about how I personally couldn’t keep up with all the new lingo. Words like “rizz,” “brainrot,” and “slaps” tumbled out of my mouth in a chaotic stream of consciousness. 

# Lessons Learned
Needless to say, I didn’t win. But what I gained was far more valuable:
* Courage – Just stepping onto that stage was a win for me.
* Humility – Messing up in front of an audience teaches you to laugh at yourself.
* Growth – Every stumble is a step forward, and I now have a clearer idea of what to work on.

So, to anyone thinking about trying their luck in a speech contest: go for it. You might fumble, you might embarrass yourself, but at the very least, you’ll walk away with a story to tell—and maybe even a new appreciation for the art of public speaking.

Here’s to my next attempt (and to learning how to stick to the format)!
