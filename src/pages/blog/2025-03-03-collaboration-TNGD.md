ðŸŒŸ Fostering Friendships and New Connections: TMIKL x TNG Toastmasters ðŸŒŸ

On Wednesday, 16 October 2024, the TMIKL Toastmasters Club and Touch 'N Go Group Toastmasters Club hosted an inspiring collaboration meeting under the theme "Fostering Friendships and New Connections." Held at the stunning Secret Garden, Touch 'N Go Sdn Bhd, the event was a vibrant mix of learning, networking, and community building.

The evening started with a warm welcome and pre-event networking session, accompanied by delightful refreshments. Members and guests exchanged stories and set the stage for an enriching event ahead. The meeting featured captivating speeches, lively table topics, and insightful evaluations, showcasing the remarkable skills and passion within both clubs.

Something unexpected for readers is that I am the organizing chair for the event. That's right! Me! I have been a toastmaster for 1 year yet, here I was... Leading this prestigious event, with one of the most, if not the most famous FinTech company in Malaysia. There was a lot of pressure on me to ensure that this event went through. To reduce my stress of having to look for a GE, I volunteered myself to be one.

An intriguing twist to the night was the unexpected attendance of numerous district leaders! At first, their presence took everyone by surprise, but upon reflection, it became evident that their curiosity was piqued by this promising up-and-coming club. Their participation and keen interest added an extra layer of excitement and inspiration to the evening, highlighting the growing reputation of the TNG Toastmasters Club.

The GE was not as spectacular though. He fumbled a lot, keep moving in and out of the stage. He tried to be funny but often, it fell flat and the VPPR was very late in announcing the event on social media. There was a lot to be improved overall on the event. I should make it clear that I am both the GE, and the VPPR.

The collaboration embodied the true spirit of Toastmasters, where individuals come together to grow, connect, and thrive. A special thank you to Hazim and Yuan Ni, the dedicated organizers, for orchestrating such a memorable event.

All in all, the event went a whole better than I expected, no doubt to the strength of the members and the roleplayers, and the speakers, and the evaluators present in the meeting. I was more than happy at the end of the event, and that is not just because my job was over at the end of the day.

Here's to more collaborations, newfound friendships, and continued growth in the Toastmasters journey! ðŸŽ‰
