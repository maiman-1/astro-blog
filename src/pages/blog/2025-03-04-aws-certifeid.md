For the past year, my boss has been practically hounding me to get this AWS certification. And honestly? I kept putting it off.  Looking back, I can’t believe how much I procrastinated. Although, to be fair to myself, I was still green to the job and I was trying to get used to being in a new house and everything. My boss clearly saw the value in it and kept pushing me because they knew it would benefit both me and the team. It wasn’t until I finally committed to a two-week crash course that I realized how long I’d been avoiding something that wasn’t as impossible as I’d convinced myself it was. Safe to say, I owe a lot of thanks to their persistence!

Anyways, it was the final review for me and my boss at the end of the year, and of course, he got off and I decided "That's enough procrastination. By hook or crook, even if I failed, at least I tried...". It was at that point, I decided to use the voucher that I was been sitting off for almost an entire year and booked an examination a whole month in advance.

You probably realized that I said I only had 2 weeks of studying in my summary and here, I said I booked the exam a whole month in exam... Well, that's because more procrastination occured!

Thank god for my company and the insight platform that allowed me to study my a** off in the last 2 weeks! Yup. In the last 2 weeks before the examination, I got my plan going, and each day after work, I just stayed there and watch a couple of videos about the exam preparation.

Then, in the last weeks, I did some exam preparation, more studying and suprisingly.... I barely passed the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner Test! That's right. I got the marks "Atas pagar" as the locals say it.

At the end of it all, I was finally able to say that I am somewhat familiar with this tool if someone asks me. This serves as evidence for my competency, not just with interviewers, but also internally within my own company. Sufficed to say, I also learned a whole lot about the tools that I've been for close to a year! Typically speaking, with a tool, you don't need to learn much about how it works just... How to use it. Like a tv, for example, you don't need to know how TV works to "use" the tv.

But, learning about the electronic side within the tv allows you to utilize and even repair the tv a whole lot better. That's the outcome I got from learning with this certification.
