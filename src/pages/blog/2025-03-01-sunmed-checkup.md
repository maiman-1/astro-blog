As a software engineer, I spend most of my days glued to a screen, debugging code, and surviving on coffee and convenience. So, when my work insurance reminded me that I could claim a medical checkup, I thought, “Why not?” Add in the fact that Sunway Medical Center was offering a 25% discount for their 25th anniversary, and it felt like the universe was nudging me to prioritize my health—for once.

The Checkup I Almost Skipped
To be completely honest, I didn’t have a burning desire to go for the checkup. It wasn’t some grand realization about my well-being or a New Year’s resolution. It was the insurance coverage and the discount that sealed the deal. It felt like a good way to tick off the “adulting” checklist without burning a hole in my wallet.

I showed up at Sunway Medical Center, impressed by their welcoming staff and modern facilities. The checkup itself was pretty standard—blood tests, blood pressure, BMI measurements, the works. “No big deal,” I thought, as I mentally prepared myself to brag to my friends about how responsible I was being.

The Verdict: High Cholesterol?!
A few days later, I got my results. Everything seemed fine… until I saw it: high cholesterol. High cholesterol? Me? I mean, sure, I may not be the poster child for healthy eating, but I didn’t expect that.

Naturally, I blamed it on the lamb shank I’d devoured the night before the checkup. I can’t prove it, but I’m convinced that tender, delicious piece of meat sabotaged me. I even Googled “how fast lamb shank raises cholesterol levels” to back up my theory (spoiler: the science didn’t side with me).

Lessons Learned (Sort Of)
While the lamb shank may or may not have been the culprit, the checkup was a wake-up call. As much as I’d like to believe I’m invincible—just like the code I write before running it through QA—my health isn’t something I can ignore.

The good news? The 25% discount and my insurance claim took some of the sting out of the experience. The bad news? I’ll probably have to cut back on lamb shanks (and nasi lemak, and burgers, and… you get the idea).

In the end, I’m grateful I went for the checkup, even if my motivations weren’t entirely noble. The Sunway Medical Center staff made the process smooth, and the results gave me a nudge to start making smarter choices—after all, even software engineers need to prioritize self-maintenance.

So, to my fellow screen warriors out there: If your work insurance covers a checkup, take it. And maybe skip the lamb shank the night before.
