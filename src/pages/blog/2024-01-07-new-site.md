# Trying out a new blog site

Hey friends! Switching things up for the next blog, and guess what? AstroJS is in the mix now. Why? Well, it just seemed like a good idea for a more fun and flexible vibe.

AstroJS brings in some cool tricks with static sites and dynamic loading. So, let's see how it goes! No big promises, just exploring AstroJS and seeing what it can do for the blog. Stick around, and let's keep it chill and see where this ride takes us!

# My last blog

For my last blog, I've been cruising with Jekyll, and it's been quite the journey. Jekyll, with its simplicity and ease of use, has been my trusty sidekick in bringing my thoughts and ideas to life. From hassle-free content management to straightforward customization, Jekyll has been the engine behind the scenes.

It's been a good run, and Jekyll's structure has kept things organized and straightforward. But, you know how it goesâ€”change is in the air. Stay tuned as I share the highs and quirks of my Jekyll days while gearing up for the exciting shift to AstroJS for the next chapter.

# Challenge

Jekyll, my go-to for the last blog, has been a solid companion in the realm of static site generators. Its simplicity served me well, but as the blog evolved, I found myself yearning for a bit more flexibility in the development playground.

Being a static site, Jekyll had its limitations. The straightforward nature that once felt like a breeze became a bit restricting as I aimed for a more dynamic and interactive user experience. The rigid structure made certain tweaks and improvements a tad challenging.

So, here I am, looking to level up the game. It's not a farewell to Jekyll but rather a quest for a more dynamic approach that allows for easier development, seamless improvements, and a touch more flair in the user experience.


# Eyeing ReactJS: The Untapped Potential

I was aware of ReactJS and I've always wanted to switch my blog site to use ReactJS. I had been putting off on it for two reasons: 1. I didn't know how to put up a React site using Github Pages and 2. I don't want to have to go through all the hassel of making the switch only to find out that Github Pages can't host a React site. So, I sat on it for a while and I kinda got bored of writing stuff on my blog site because of the issues I've written above.

It was a sunny afternoon day when I saw a post on r/webdevelopment I think about this stack, AstroJS. I thought to myself "That's cool. But, it's not like I can host this stack on Github Pages". But, the reference docs on the stack itself shows a clear, and simple path to host a site built on this stack on Github Pages. When I saw this, I nearly jumped out of my seat. "Finally! I can make the switch!" I thought to myself.

Then, a couple of hours later, taking down the jekyll site, and creating the barebones of the AstroJS site. There it was, my new blog site. Made with a programming framework that I am more familiar with. Oh boy was I excited. I was like a kid in a candy store, looking at how I can just implement other css stacks and modules, by just using NodeJS.

# Conclusion

So, that's the story for this new blog site. I've been thinkering on it for a while and I'm much more excited to do stuff on this site than my previous one. With it being a dynamic site, there's a lot more potential for this to be used and I can showcase more technical stuff probably. Thanks for reading!
